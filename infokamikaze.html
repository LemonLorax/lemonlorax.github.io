      <p class="text">Kamikaze pilots were first employed on October 25, 1944. The tactic was first shown in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which was the largest navel battle in history. These Kamikazes were special forces tasked with flying into Allied ships which planes strapped with tons of explosives. These would create massive damage into ships and killed thousands of Allied sailors. Motoharu Okamura was the commander of the Kamikaze squadron and firmly believed that crash-diving attacks would turn the tide of the war. Kamikazes would be used throughtout the rest of the war. More than 3,000 Japanese pilots ended up dying and more than 7,000 American, Australian and British troops also died to the tactic. In the end, Okamura was wrong and the Kamikazes did not turn the tide of the war and Japan surrendered after the two atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagisaki.
         A specialized plane was made for Kamikaze pilots which was basically a human guided missle. It was built to be able to plunge down at battleships with a lot of force and its nose which was filled with explosive charges weighed more than a ton. The Allies nicknamed these missiles "Baka Bombs" from the Japanese word for fool or idiot. Kamikaze attacks sunk 34 ships and damaged hundreds of others. The best way the Allies found to take out stop a Kamikaze attack from happeneing was to station destroyers, which is a type of warship, around capital ships and make then shoot the planes out of the air with antiaircraft batteries. Kamikaze pilots were young men and they would performed a special ceremony of drinking sake and eating rice before flying. They were also given medals and a Katana sword during these cerremonies. The pilots also carried beloved possessions to be treasured upon death </p>
