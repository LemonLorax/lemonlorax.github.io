      <p class="text">Members of a special Japanese air force group back in World War II which were assigned a suicide misson. The Kamikaze planes were strapped with a bunch of explosives and piolets were command to crash into American battleships which would inflict large amounts of damage to the warships. Many of the piolets were very divoted to their country and would proudly die for Japan. Around 3,800 kamikaze piolets died throughout World War II. </p>

      <p class="text">Takehiko Ena is a former kamikaze pilot who survived being sent out with 800kg of explosives strapped to his plane. He said "The other pilots and I congratulated each other when the order came through that we were going to attack. It sounds strange now, as there was nothing to celebrate." Ena was a part of a squadron of pilots in Kyushu in April 1945 when the kamikaze were at their most active. He was the pilot of a three man crew of a plane with a 1,763 pound bomb strapped to its undercarriage with the amount of fuel for a one way trip. When Ena was sent out, this plane ended up having technical issues which made it crash land into the ocean. The three men were able to escape onto a deserted island and was were for two and a half months and when he got back, it was only a week from when the first bomb hit Hiroshima which lead into the second one being dropped a couple days later which called the end of the war. </p>
